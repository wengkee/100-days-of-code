**Today's Progress**: Studying Python on Udemy.
**Thoughts**: After dropping Python for few years and done a little bit of Java, coming back to Python reminds me of learning Go. A breath of fresh cold air, ease of programming. And just how easy it is to build some simple stuff.

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Openshift Sandbox! 
**Thoughts**: Came across a Redhat blog talking about learning Kubernetes, and it mentions about the free service provided by Redhat - a  30 days free dedicated Openshift sandbox environment! It's pretty easy to sue, reminds me a bit of Azure Devops interface. With just a few clicks, I managed to deploy my [simple dice web app](http://dice-wengkeeteh-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/) on the cluster. Nice!

**Today's Progress**: Still on Python turtle module.

**Thoughts**: Using the turtle module to create a turtle race, a etch-a-sketch! I have also started on building the Snake game - the one we used to play with Nokia 3310.

**Today's Progress**: Learning List Comprehension and Dictionary Comprehension in Python

**Thoughts**: List/ Dictionary Comprehension in Python is so powerful! The syntax is intuitive, multiple lines code replaced by 1 liner, sweet!

>### Day 11: 2021-7-5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Learning tkinter, *args and **kwargs in Python

**Thoughts**: I didn't know that it is possible to declare functions with multi optional arguments, I think it is pretty neat in certain situations, where you might have too many arguments to pack in 1 function. Definitely a nice thing to have.
