**Today's Progress**: Studying Python on Udemy.
**Thoughts**: After dropping Python for few years and done a little bit of Java, coming back to Python reminds me of learning Go. A breath of fresh cold air, ease of programming. And just how easy it is to build some simple stuff.

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Openshift Sandbox! 
**Thoughts**: Came across a Redhat blog talking about learning Kubernetes, and it mentions about the free service provided by Redhat - a  30 days free dedicated Openshift sandbox environment! It's pretty easy to sue, reminds me a bit of Azure Devops interface. With just a few clicks, I managed to deploy my [simple dice web app](http://dice-wengkeeteh-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/) on the cluster. Nice!
