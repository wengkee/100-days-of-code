>### Day 5: Feb 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally getting back to the challenge after almost 2 weeks break during Chinese New Year. Getting back into the challenge proves to be much harder than I thought. It's a slow burn today, reading articles and videos.

**Thoughts**: There is no single best programming language out there, only the suitable one for the suitable situation.
