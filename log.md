**Today's Progress**: Studying Python on Udemy.
**Thoughts**: After dropping Python for few years and done a little bit of Java, coming back to Python reminds me of learning Go. A breath of fresh cold air, ease of programming. And just how easy it is to build some simple stuff.

**Today's Progress**: Playing with Openshift Sandbox! 
**Thoughts**: Came across a Redhat blog talking about learning Kubernetes, and it mentions about the free service provided by Redhat - a  30 days free dedicated Openshift sandbox environment! It's pretty easy to sue, reminds me a bit of Azure Devops interface. With just a few clicks, I managed to deploy my [simple dice web app](http://dice-wengkeeteh-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/) on the cluster. Nice!

**Today's Progress**: Still on Python turtle module.

**Thoughts**: Using the turtle module to create a turtle race, a etch-a-sketch! I have also started on building the Snake game - the one we used to play with Nokia 3310.

**Today's Progress**: Written a python script to host http / https server. Also continue to learn and develop Snake game.

**Thoughts**: Let's continue to do this! An hour a day, 7 days a week, every little step matters!
