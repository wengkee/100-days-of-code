>### Day 1: Jan 16, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started picking up Golang, written my first Hello World with it. Watched some videos about it.

**Thoughts**: The syntax is quite simple, still yet to know its full potential.

>### Day 5: Feb 5, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finally getting back to the challenge after almost 2 weeks break during Chinese New Year. Getting to a slow burn start, reading articles and videos.

**Thoughts**: There is no single best programming language out there, only the suitable one for the suitable situation.
